# KORUZA Software Package

To build the software package for the ARM-based KORUZA compute module, you
need a working Docker installation. Then run the following:
```bash
./build.sh
```

After the build process completes, you get everything packaged in a Debian
package called `koruza_1.0-1.deb`. To install or upgrade the package, run
the following on the KORUZA compute module:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i koruza_1.0-1.deb
```

If you get some missing dependencies, be sure to also run:
```bash
sudo apt-get -f install
```

## Motor homing tests

In order to run continuous motor homing test every time the compute module
is rebooted, run the following and reboot the device:
```bash
sudo uci set koruza.@motors[0].test=1
sudo uci commit koruza
```

To disable the tests later:
```bash
sudo uci set koruza.@motors[0].test=0
sudo uci commit koruza
```

## Configuring a serial number

In order to configure a serial number for the unit (e.g., `0001`) run:
```bash
sudo uci set koruza.@unit[0].serial_number=0001
```

If this command gives you an invalid argument error, run the following:
```bash
sudo uci add koruza unit
sudo uci set koruza.@unit[0].serial_number=0001
```

Commit the changes by running:
```
sudo uci commit koruza
```


## Configuring monitoring push location

In order to configure the URL where the unit should push data (e.g., for `push.kw.koruza.net`), run:
```bash
sudo uci set nodewatcher.@agent[0].push_url_template=https://push.kw.koruza.net/push/http/{uuid}
sudo uci commit nodewatcher
```
